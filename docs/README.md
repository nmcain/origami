# Origami Editor

**About**

This is a tool for creating progressive web apps after the Chrome Dev editor fell out of use 
due to very strict content security policies in the new version of Chrome.


## To Use

I do have monthly builds on this [projects homepage](https://nmcain.github.io/origami) which are availible for easy installations.
This is reccomended for users with less command line experience.

**Building and running from source**

If you want the latest updates and more features faster, you can clone this repository and build it yourself. If you make a great feature or find a problem, don't forget to create an issue or suggestion. 

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/nmcain/origami
# Go into the repository
cd origami
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.

## Updates

As you may already be able to tell, there are different branches. Beta has the latest features, but with the latest features, come the latest bugs. You can help by reporting them, or fixing them yourself.

## License

The different APIs and libraries used may have different licenses, but Origami uses the Apache License, with some modifications.
I don't really see the need for a warranty, but I will provide support (within reason) for this application and I will try to provide support for derivative works that do not. Also please try to credit me and the other contributors in your derivative works.
